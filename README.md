# What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is a time-stamped decentralized series of fixed records that contains data of any size is controlled by a large network of computers which are scattered around the globe and not owned by a single organization. Every block is secured and connected with each other using hashing technology which protects it from being tempered by an unauthorized person.
